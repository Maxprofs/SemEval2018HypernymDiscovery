The Syatem is evaluated against both modules individually and then by combining the results.
The PART 1: 1A.english.output.trial.norm.txt 	: Based on Co-occurance and Bag of words
The PART 2: 1A.english.output.trial.hearst.txt	: Based on Hearst Patterns
The PART 3: 1A.english.output.trial.merge.txt	: BAST on PART 1 and PART 2
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Analysis of the Results:
1. The system seem to perform fairly well with co-occurance and bag of words.
2. Hearts patterns could not provide much help as agisnt when alayed manually. [Why? Answerd in Swathi_Project-reprt.txt]
3. So merging the results was close to PART 1 only.
