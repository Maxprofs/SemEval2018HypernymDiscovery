Some files in the Output directory are output files generated by different modules of System_Babbage.
Following files are present in the current directory.
1. 1A.english.output.(train|train).norm.txt
	- output produced by cooccurrance module from stage 1.
2. 1A.english.output.(train|trial).hearst.txt
	- output produced by Hearst module from stage 1.
3. Stage2_Model1_(train|trial).txt
	- output produced by Part-Of for bi/tri-gram concept + Hearst-IS-A module from stage 2.
4. Stage2_Phi01_(train|trial).txt
	- output produced by Phi module using formula X + PhiX (details described in Swathi_report.odt)
5. Stage2_Phi02_(train|trial).txt
	- output produced by Phi module using formula X - PhiX (details described in Swathi_report.odt)
6. Stage1_norm_hearst.txt
	- output produced by merging files (1) and (2)
7. Stage2_PHI_01_02.txt
	- output produced by merging files (4) and (5)
8. Stage1_Stage2_PHIModule.txt
	- output produced by merging (6) and (7)
9. Stage2_Model1_Stage1_Stage2_PHIModule.txt
	- output produced by merging files (3) and (8)
	- this is the final output of System_Babbage
10. RES.CON.TXT
	- The results for CONCEPTS of Sample Data split
11. RES.ENT.TXT
	- The results for ENTITIES of Sample Data split
12. input.con.txt
        - The Gold DATA - CONCEPTS for Sample Data split
13. input.con.txt
	- The Gold DATA - ENTITIES for Sample Data split
14. Evalution_Report.LOG
        - evaluation results from files (1) to (11) produced by task9-scorer.py @ ../src/Merge/
15. Model1.LOG
	- This is the log generated my Stage 2 - Model 1 module
16. Model2.LOG
	- This is the log generated my PHIModule - Stage 2 Model 2

Note : Merged files (6) to (9) are produced by merging module mergeTwoResults.py @ ../src/Merge/
       Split files (10) to (13) are generated by splitting the files into concepts and entitis by looking at (trian|trial) data file
       1A.english.training.data.txt by using SeparateCEOp.py @ ../src/Merge/
