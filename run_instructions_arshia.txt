To produce output using a word2vec (CBOW/skip-gram) model -
	
	Create CBOW/skip-gram model using (normalized) data corpus.
	Or, Download sample CBOW model from - https://drive.google.com/open?id=1yo5war0dWTKsQi6Qk0je48QCIWqt90vg 
		There are three files in the directory which should be all present together in order for the model to work. 
			UMBCNewNormNOStopCBOW_20_10 (This is the main model)
			UMBCNewNormNOStopCBOW_20_10.syn1neg.npy (Secondary file)
			UMBCNewNormNOStopCBOW_20_10.wv.syn0.npy (Secondary file)
	
	In directory "hyperstar_for_skipgram_cbow_w2v" run -
		./driver.sh <path to pre-generated word2vec model to be used>
		
	Example run -
		./driver.sh UMBCNewNormNOStopCBOW_20_10
			Assuming model is in directory "hyperstar_for_skipgram_cbow_w2v" too.
			
			
To produce output using a GloVe (CBOW/skip-gram) model -
	
	Download normalized data from - 
		https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ZPzg5ctUtnUDAxb7M6nwUFG_Pk65Of1J

	The whole data is contained in a single file called merged_data.norm.3
	
	Create GloVe model :
	From directory create_glove_w2v run - 
		./experiment.sh <path to normalized data file>
	
	If data file is in directory create_glove_w2v run -
		./experiment.sh merged_data.norm.3
		
	This will produce vectors.txt which is the GloVe text format model.
	
	To convert it to word2vec format run - 
		python -m gensim.scripts.glove2word2vec –i vectors.txt –o w2v.txt
		
	To produce output using the new model -
		Go to directory "hyperstar_for_glove_w2v"
		Run - ./driver.sh ../create_glove_w2v/w2v.txt
			
	You can download a pre-generated GloVe-W2V model from here -
