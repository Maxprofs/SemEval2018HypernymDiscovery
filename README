Project : Hypernym Discovery (SemEval 2018: task 9)
Team : Babbage
Team members (in alphabatical order) : Arshia Zernab Hassan, Swathi Manikya Vallabhajosyula

Problem Description : 
 Hypernym discovery task involves producing potential hypernyms given a hyponym and ranking these hypernyms. This paper explores several approaches to address this problem. Our system employs co-occurrence frequencies, Hearst patterns and word embeddings created using normalized data to achieve this goal. This model is built as a solution to the SemEval 2018 Task 9 - Hypernym Discovery.

Solution :

Stage 1 - Co-occarence frequency from Normalization and Hearst Patterns
Stage 2 (System_babbage) -  results form word embedddings
